import time

time.sleep(15) # Replace the number with the seconds you want it to freeze

# After executing, the timer will freeze! You can hit
# Ctrl/Strg+Alt+Delete/Entfernen
# to get to the quick security menu
# From there, open Task Manager and all windows functions are re-enabled without TI seeing that you are away


# REMEMBER TO GET BACK TO TI BEFORE THE TIME RUNS OUT
# How it works:
#
# Texas Instruments has made an mistake while porting python to TI CAS
# When calling the sleep function, the python runtime blocks the main process
# This includes the timer and the function to check if the user exited the program.
# The python process is not affected and continues to execute.
